## Loading and verification

- Read the full root-to-file instruction chain, including nested guides. Tests also use their source owner's guides; they do not inherit `src/` instructions automatically.
- Build, dependency, lockfile, locale/static-asset import, and `esbuild.config.mjs` changes also require `scripts/AGENTS.md`. Composition changes require the guides of the services being wired.
- Use `.node-version`. The default code check is:

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build && npm run check:performance
```

- Dev and production builds load `.env.local` and may copy artifacts into the configured `OBSIDIAN_VAULT`, including removal of its old `.codex-vendor`. Check that destination before building; clearing the shell variable does not prevent reloading it from the file.

## Architectural constraints

- `src/main.ts` is the sole concrete composition root and lifecycle publisher. App subcomposition returns complete domains, never a second root or service locator.
- App repositories/settings/storage depend on core contracts, not feature orchestration or provider-native protocols. Concrete provider imports are confined to composition and provider-default assembly.
- Features use `FeatureHost` and core registries, never concrete app/provider implementations. Providers use `ProviderHost`, never feature orchestration. Core imports none of these implementations.
- Existing Claude compatibility re-exports into app settings/storage are exceptions, not precedent. Do not extend them; move shared contracts to core when materially changing those seams.
- Shared ACP code contains protocol mechanics only; provider launch policy, extensions, normalization, and history stay provider-owned.
- `@claudian-collab/protocol` is an exact registry dependency owned by its standalone repository. Import only its package root; retain no package source, source aliases, copied registries, compatibility policy, or core re-exports.

## Provider policy

- Do not assume provider parity. Check the owning capabilities, registration, and UI config before sharing behavior; use `ProviderRegistry` and `ProviderWorkspaceRegistry`.
- App/features may store opaque provider state but may not interpret native session/checkpoint fields. Providers normalize native payloads at the core boundary.
- Prefer native provider behavior. Inspect real runtime output when uncertain. Live output and history replay remain separate; conversation changes never mutate or delete native history.
- Persisted provider settings require runtime decoding; invalid permission/tool/sandbox modes fail closed. Writers merge provider-owned configuration.
- Chat offers only explicitly enabled models from enabled providers; an empty model selection stays empty. No synthetic entry, hidden session model, or default fallback may bypass provider or model enablement.
- Runtime-discovered commands are read-only. Auxiliary queries own processes/sessions independently from chat.

## Local conventions

- Use English for code/comments/identifiers/commits/code blocks. Soft-wrap Markdown. Put uncommitted notes, traces, and throwaway scripts in `.context/`. No production `console.*`.
- No interface `I` prefix. Treat acronyms as words except external SDK types.
- Files use PascalCase for their main concept, camelCase for utility bags, kebab-case only for external package names. Keep `index.ts` barrels, `types.ts` buckets, and source-mirrored test names. Folders use kebab-case; imports omit `.ts` and prefer `@/`.

## Required test workflow

- Behavior changes require a failing executable test before implementation. Documentation/mechanical changes are exempt; when automation is infeasible, record repeatable failure and test the nearest stable seam.
- Documented owners/public contracts are accepted seams. Resolve ownership before testing beyond them; no test-only public facade.
- Complete one observable behavior before refactoring or adding another. Derive expectations independently from specs, accepted fixtures, captured native examples, or worked examples; no mirrored algorithms, internal call-count assertions, or storage inspection behind undeclared seams.
- Do not test statically defined values whose correctness is already established by their source or type declaration. Test the observable behavior that consumes them only when that behavior has meaningful regression risk.
- When logic is deleted, do not add negative tests that merely prove the removed path no longer exists. Cover only the observable replacement behavior or contract that could realistically regress.
- Mock only environment, Obsidian, and provider boundaries through narrow ports; keep owned modules real. Shared provider changes need neutral-contract coverage plus distinct native adapter behavior.
- Atomic UI actions use native controls with explicit non-submit button types. Non-native controls need justified semantics and complete name/role/keyboard coverage.
- Real-DOM tests use Testing Library role/name queries and outcome assertions, plus targeted jest-axe checks. MockElement class/tag checks do not substitute.

## Instruction maintenance

- Retain only scope-specific constraints an agent could plausibly miss. Remove code descriptions, inventories, generic advice, and repeated inherited rules.
- Put each constraint at its narrowest common scope. Explain necessary exceptions. Record only active, non-obvious, costly decisions with a real tradeoff; archive retired decisions in Git.
- Each guide has a sibling `CLAUDE.md` containing only `@AGENTS.md`.

## Branching & Upstream Sync

This repo is a fork. `origin` is the upstream (`YishenTu/claudian`); `myfork` is the working remote (`pennn778/claudian`). Two long-lived branches:

- `main` — pristine mirror of `origin/main`. Never commit here.
- `custom` — where local customizations live; periodically rebased onto fresh `main`.

`branch.{main,custom}.pushRemote` is set to `myfork`, so `git push` never reaches upstream.

**Sync upstream** (when `origin/main` advances):

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only origin/main
git checkout custom
git rebase main                           # resolve conflicts if any
git push myfork custom --force-with-lease
```

**Adding a customization**: commit on `custom`, then `git push` (defaults to `myfork`).
